This is our Lua game.

Built using Love2D as well as some other things to help out. Namely Anim8, Tiled (with Simple-Tiled-Implementation), Hump (aka: Helper Utilities for Massive Progression), and Windfield.

We are hoping for this to feel familiar to those who have played the Legend of Zelda games, but with a bit of a twist in terms of story.
